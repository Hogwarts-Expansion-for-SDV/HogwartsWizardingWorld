        /*How did the player meet Ollivander? (just passing by or visiting the shop), logically he won't perform the spell in front of the player without any reason. -> Lead to Ollivander and the player speak about it, and move into the positions.
        Adding the message to signify a change of scene like "A long time ago" or something. Why would Ollivander appear in front of Albus grave, is this a flashback or something?
        Pausing in the middle of the speak then speak again make it feel like Ollivander is analyzing/pondering.
        globalFade/viewport -1000 -1000/pause 1000 at the very end is unnecessary unless the scene bug out without them. 
        Add move/facedirection occasionally to make the cutscene feel more dynamic.
        Using shake, playSound, playMusic.
        Approaching = make the NPC move 1 tile closer.*/
